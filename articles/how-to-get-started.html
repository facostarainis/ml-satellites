                    The combination of <b>satellite imagery</b> and <b>artificial intelligence</b> (AI) is a powerful tool for data
                    journalism investigations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But, what kind of stories can be told? How to get started?
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the aim of paving the way for journalists who want to use satellite imagery and AI in their
                    work, in this two-part article I share what I learned after talking to experts and doing my own
                    experiments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this first part, you'll find <b>suggestions</b> on how to get started and avoid the most common
                    pitfalls. If you are looking for story <b>ideas</b>, visit the second part by clicking
                    <a href="ideas.html">here</a>.
                </p>


                <h4>Before you start</h4>
                <p>
                    Working with satellite imagery and AI models takes time and patience. There is no general rule: you
                    have to find the right model for each case, in a process of trial and error, while crunching large
                    amounts of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That is why the advice of <b>Anatoly Bondarenko</b>, data editor of
                    <a href="https://texty.org.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        Texty</a>, is crucial: "Find a task or story where you will not be sorry to put many resources
                    in."
                </p>
                <p> <mark> 
                    The combination of satellite imagery and AI is useful for providing general context where no data
                    exists, discovering patterns over large territories or over time, counting scattered objects or
                    finding needles in a haystack.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "AI makes sense when you want to do things at a larger scale or repeatedly. Either because you're
                    working on such a big area that it's impractical to do it as a human or because you want to do it
                    again and again over time," says <b>Edward Boyda</b> from <b>Earthrise</b>, who worked on the
                    <a href="https://amazonminingwatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        Amazon Mining Watch project</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before you go any further, ask yourself: is this the best tool to tell the story?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps there is an easier or more efficient way to get the information you are looking for. There
                    may already be a dataset available, or you may be able to get it through a public information
                    request. Or you may manually count objects in a satellite image, without the need for AI.
                </p>


                <h4>Know the territory and the basic tools</h4>
                <p>
                    If you decide to go ahead, the next step is to familiarise yourself with your <b>region of interest
                    (ROI)</b> and the basic tools you will use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the advantages of satellite data is that it allows you to investigate from afar: you can
                    observe any corner of the globe from your computer. But you should still familiarise with the ROI in
                    order to interpret your findings correctly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can visit the site, so much the better; if not, gather as much information as you can about
                    it. Find out what the problems or hot topics are, get non-satellite images, contact local people or
                    experts that work there. This will help you to minimise errors during the analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Edward says that <mark>satellite imagery is useful for investigating areas where it is "hard for
                    journalists to operate", but that it should always be used "in a combination with traditional on the
                    ground reporting", as satellites are "useful for illustrating or quantifying, but don't bring that
                    human story element in".</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for the tools, take some time to experiment and choose the ones you are most comfortable with or
                    can best adapt to your case. Start with the familiar: if you already know <b>R</b> or <b>Python</b>, for example,
                    look for libraries such as
                    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RStoolbox/index.html" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">

                <b>You don't always need to write code:</b> there is free software with AI algorithms for classifying
                    images or detecting objects. Two very useful ones are

                    <li>
                        If this is still not enough, then it's time to create your own framework by combining different
                        tools.

                <h4>Ask for help from others</h4>
                <p>
                    Most journalistic pieces that use AI and satellite imagery are <b>collaborative projects</b> and rely on a
                    data expert.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can look for help in
                    <a href="https://gis.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                        other journalists</a>
                    who have used such techniques. But also look beyond journalism: <b>Earth Observation</b> (EO) and remote
                    sensing are used in many fields such as agriculture, ecology, biology and disaster management.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you seek advice from others before starting the technical work, you will avoid some of the dead
                    ends that others have already gone down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is not just about solving technical problems. An NGO working on environmental issues may be able

                        high-resolution images</a>, give you hard-to-get information about your ROI or put you in touch
                    with local experts.
                </p>
                <p>
                <mark>"This knowledge is not something that is intrinsic in the news industry, so news organisations need
                    to go where they can find it, looking at civil society organisations or startups focused on using
                    the satellite imagery,"</mark> says <b>Mathias Felipe de Lima Santos</b>, project manager of data-driven projects
                    at
                    <a href="https://infoamazonia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        InfoAmazonia</a> and researcher in the Digital Media and Observatory at the <b>Federal University
                    of São Paulo</b> (Unifesp). This way they will be able to "produce investigations that go beyond their
                    own limits".
                </p>


                <h4>Start small and be organised</h4>
                <p>
                    Always start small. Even if your ultimate ROI is a much larger area, <mark>start by limiting your analysis
                    to an area that is representative of the phenomenon you want to investigate, but as small as
                    possible.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using AI on a single satellite image takes a fair amount of <b>intellectual effort</b>, <b>computational power</b>
                    and <b>processing time</b>. As you add more images, the difficulty grows exponentially: the information to
                    be processed increases and new problems arise, such as how to stitch the images together, work out
                    the overlaps, and compare images from different dates.
                </p>
                <p>
                <mark>Do all the tests you need in a small area and only when you are satisfied with the results extend
                    the model to your entire ROI.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may be using a lot of information from different sources. Satellite imagery in raw format often
                    has complicated names, combinations of letters and numbers that reference the coordinates, date and
                    type of processing used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is good to be consistent: using a spreadsheet as a master file can help you to organise all this
                    data. As when writing code, it is better to use extra-explicit nomenclature rather than generic
                    names that will make it difficult to remember what they refer to.
                </p>



                <h4>Working with AI: models and computational power</h4>
                <p>
                    AI comes in different flavours but you will probably use one (or a combination) of the following
                    tools:
                </p>

                    Try different models - and different parameters - to see which one suits you best. Some of the best
                    known are <b>Random Forest</b>, <b>Supporting Vector Machine</b> (SVM) and <b>Nearest Neighbours</b>. Multi-layered <b>Deep
                    Learning</b> (DL) models tend to give better results, but are much more complex to build.

                    If you have to process a lot of data, consider <b>cloud computing</b>. There are free tools such as

                        Google Colab</a> or

                        Google Earth Engine</a> (GEE) that can crunch huge amounts of data and get results in a short
                    time. GEE also provides easy access to datasets from <b>Landsat</b>, <b>Sentinel</b>, and
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/" target="_blank"

                        Amazon Mining Watch</a>, for example, uses

                    "It's built around in a way that you can break the images into tiles for parallel processing and
                    that can be ingested directly by the model. So, we don't have to think about that part of the
                    pipeline," says Edward.

                    If you work on your personal computer, it's essential to have a solid-state disk (SDD), at least 8
                    or 16 GB of RAM and a good amount of available storage: a single raw satellite image often weighs
                    several gigabytes. A powerful processor, a dedicated video card and a good-sized monitor will also
                    make your work easier.

                        Scepticism</a> is a powerful weapon in journalism. Treat AI predictions like any other data:
                    don't take them for granted. Like all technology, AI does not work magic or replace traditional
                    journalism methods. Rather, it complements them.</mark>
                </p>
                <p>
                    "It's always this golden rule: 80% of the work was data. Also, a correct interpretation of data,
                    because we had to find images in big resolution, but no less important was to find some first
                    examples of the specific patterns of mining," says Anatoly about <b>Texty</b>'s investigation into
                    <a href="https://texty.org.ua/d/2018/amber_eng/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

                <p>
                    A good part of your job will be to clean up <b>false positives</b> or understand why there are so many
                    <b>false negatives</b> to improve your model. If you are working on a story about change, for example, also
                    pay attention to what didn't change and ask yourself why.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to get some ground truth to check the results of your model: field data obtained
                    directly in the area you are analysing. What looks like a crop field in the satellite image is
                    really a crop field?
                </p>
                <p>
                    That doesn't mean you have to travel: you can contact local experts to help you evaluate your
                    findings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you publish, share the <b>methodology</b> you have used, either in the piece itself or on an external
                    site such as <b>GitHub</b>. It's a good transparency practice, allows understanding your analysis process
                    and helps others interested in working on the same topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But also think about the <b>audience</b>, who don't necessarily know how AI works, and explain its scope
                    and limitations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <mark>"Journalists need to be transparent and explain not only about the metadata, but also explain what
                    AI is, what computer vision is, and how we approach that. And make clear the limitations [of the
                    model],"</mark> says Mathias.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always make explicit the gaps in your research, the things that are unverified and the levels of
                    uncertainty in your model. Putting on record what you couldn't solve doesn't diminish your work; on
                    the contrary, it makes it more reliable.

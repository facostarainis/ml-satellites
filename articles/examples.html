                    <p>The combination of satellite imagery with machine learning (ML), a branch of
                        artificial intelligence (AI), enables something unimaginable not long ago:
                        training an algorithm to process geographic big data to look for patterns,
                        specific details or changes over time.</p>

                    <p>It is a methodology that produces valuable information and has revolutionised
                        fields such as agriculture, international trade and the battle against
                        climate change, but until now it has been little used in journalism.</p>

                    <p>Since the 2018 publication of <a href="https://texty.org.ua/d/2018/amber_eng/"
                            target="_blank"><em>Leprosy of the land</em></a>, the first journalistic
                        investigation to use this technique to show the environmental impact of
                        illegal amber mining in Ukraine, there have been only a handful of similar
                        stories.</p>

                    <p>"There is a lack of understanding of what we could do with satellite
                        imageries and AI in the newsroom," says Mathias Felipe de Lima Santos,
                        project manager of data-driven projects at InfoAmazonia and researcher in
                        the Digital Media and Observatory at the Federal University of S&atilde;o
                        Paulo (Unifesp).</p>

                    <p>He points to four reasons that hinder the adoption of this technology even
                        among large media outlets:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Very few journalists have technical knowledge about AI</li>
                        <li>Media usually do not have the infrastructure (computer power) to process
                            large amounts of data</li>
                        <li>Free satellite imagery cannot identify smaller details because of its
                            low resolution</li>
                        <li>Commercially available high-resolution imagery is very expensive</li>
                    </ul>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>That's why collaboration is very important and it's a way of addressing
                            these issues, adds Mathias, who believes that partnerships with civil
                            society organisations and the private sector can help to produce
                            research that goes beyond the limitations of newsroom.</p>

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The following examples show that, when these difficulties are overcome, the
                        results are encouraging. All of these works tackle environmental issues, a
                        hot topic in journalism, and as these tools become more accessible it is to
                        be expected that more and more similar investigations will be undertaken.

                    <h2 class="section-heading"><em>Leprosy of the land</em>, where it all began</h2>

                    <p>From 2010 the rise in the international price of amber triggered a
                        <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/illegal-amber-mining-ukraine"
                            target="_blank"> mining
                            fever</a> in north-western Ukraine, country with the second largest amber
                        reserves in the world. In a context of low salaries and few opportunities,
                        thousands of informal workers turned to illegal mining, controlled by mafia
                        groups.
                    </p>

                    <p>The amber deposits are found under the forests, and to access them, trees are
                        cut down and pits are dug where pressurised water is pumped in. The result
                        is an environmental disaster with a very clear pattern from above: whole
                        areas of forest transformed into a grey, pitted, lunar desert.</p>

                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider" data-src="visualisation/10795056">
                        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
                    </div>

                    <p>By 2018, the amber situation in Ukraine was long known to journalists, but
                        there was no data on its extent. &quot;Before us no one could say what was
                        the scale of this problem,&quot; says Anatoly Bondarenko, data editor of
                        Texty, the Ukrainian agency that investigated the issue.</p>

                    <p>Inspired by a now defunct university project called <a
                            href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/meet-terrapattern-google-earths-missing-search-engine"
                            target="_blank">Terrapattern</a>, Bondarenko
                        and his team designed an algorithm to identify traces of illegal mining in
                        satellite imagery obtained via the Bing Maps API. It was a big challenge for
                        a small newsroom, only possible thanks to the initial collaboration of 20
                        volunteers who identified some 50 mining sites during an Open Data Day.</p>

                    <p>These first images were used to train the model, which was then applied to a
                        territory of 70,000 km2. The <a href="https://texty.org.ua/d/2018/amber_eng#finalmap"
                            target="_blank">map created by Texty</a> with the results showed
                        that more than 1,000 ha of forest had been affected.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>It was an unusual project, because we did it quite fast. We started, did some prototypes and
                            published it a few weeks later. It was a really interesting project, I liked to work on it
                            so much, recalls Anatoly.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we sent our results to different governmental structures and we organised a
                            couple of press conferences, but nothing was done.</p>
                    </blockquote>


                    <p>Illegal mining eventually declined, not because the government fought it,
                        but because amber prices fell and the activity became less lucrative.</p>

                    <p>Leprosy of the Land was a groundbreaking story that demonstrated a
                        powerful new research tool. Nominated for the Prix Europa 2018 awards and
                        winner of an SND 2018 award, it is already a classic of data journalism.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Gold, guns and drugs in the deep Amazon</h2>

                    <p>The Amazon also faces the ravages of open-pit mining, but for gold. The lungs
                        of the planet suffer twice: deforestation plus water pollution, because
                        mining takes place around rivers, polluting them with sediment and heavy
                        metals such as mercury.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://earthrise.media/" target="_blank">Earthrise Media</a> is a digital agency
                        created by data scientists, specialised
                        in environmental investigations through analysis of satellite imagery. For
                        several years they have been investigating the Amazon and collaborating with
                        different media, using the power of AI to observe the region from the sky.
                    </p>

                    <p>As a result of this collaborative work, in 2021 InfoAmazonia published <a

                        which
                        reveals the expansion of mining in the region of Par√°, Brazil.</p>

                    <p>The algorithm, based on Sentinel-2 imagery, detected 4700 mining points
                        compared to 2700 in 2016 - a growth of almost 75%. In the mined areas, where
                        there used to be trees, there are now only pools full of toxic water.</p>

                    <p>The investigation also showed how the sediments produced by the activity
                        spread over 500km, turning the rivers bright yellow in satellite images.</p>

                        journalists, activists and citizens to access detailed and very recent
                        information on mining activities.</p>

                    <p>Amazon Mining Watch is based on an <a href="https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector"
                            target="_blank">open source</a> convolutional neural network,
                        which processes 440m sided terrain tiles and achieves an accuracy of 98.2%.
                        For every 500 mine detections, there are only about nine misclassifications.
                    </p>

                    <p>"It went relatively quickly over - says Edward Boyda, journalist,
                        physicist and managing partner at Earthrise about the creation of the
                        algorithm - Probably about a month of effort, but it leans really heavily on
                        previous work that we had done for years and that we were able to transfer
                        to that purpose". Part of that previous work was an exhaustive initial
                        manual identification of some affected sectors, which was necessary to train
                        the model.</p>

                    <p>Adapting the same algorithm to another context, Earthrise teamed up with the
                        Australian Mineroo Foundation to create another platform, <a
                            href="https://globalplasticwatch.org/" target="_blank"><em>Global Plastic Watch</em></a>,
                        which detects plastic landfills and establishes their risk rates in
                        more than 60 countries around the world.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Looking for needles in a haystack -or how to map
                        Argentina's solar farms</h2>

                    <p>Satellite imagery is not just for revealing environmental abuses; it can also
                        help in the classic watchdog role of journalism.</p>

                    <p>In 2020, LN Data, the data team of the Argentinean newspaper La
                        Naci√≥n, used this technology to <a
                            href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tecnologia/inteligencia-artificial-mapear-parques-solares-argentina-nid2370879/"
                            target="_blank">track the construction of solar farms</a>
                        across the country and verify that the government was fulfilling its
                        commitments. A daunting task, given that Argentina is the eighth largest
                        country in the world.</p>

                    <p>To develop the project, LN Data partnered with Dymaxion Labs, a startup
                        specialising in geospatial data processing. Using cloud computing, they
                        created and trained a model that processed 7 million images from ESA's
                        Sentinel-2 satellite.</p>

                    <p>The algorithm correctly detected 20 of the 24 officially tendered solar farms
                        and also discovered two other private facilities. A demonstration of how AI
                        can find a needle (or several needles) in a haystack.</p>

                    <p>As solar farms are similar in structure and shape to agricultural farms, the
                        algorithm relied on infrared bands to differentiate between them.</p>

                    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider" data-src="visualisation/10798590">
                        <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
                    </div>

                    <p>But it is key to keep in mind that no technology is magic, nor does it
                        replace traditional reporting. &quot;When you find something, you need to go
                        and investigate that,&quot; says Mathias, who was involved in the
                        investigation.</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>We finished the project and these solar parks seemed to be, more or
                            less, at the same level as the government's proposal. But when another
                            journalist investigated in deep about some of the solar farms, she found out
                            that they were built but not actually working.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>The companies had indeed delivered the projects on time, but the government had had problems
                        connecting these stations to the national grid. This was not something that could be detected
                        from the sky.</p>

                    <p>It is a good example that underlines that technological developments come to help rather than
                        replace traditional journalism.

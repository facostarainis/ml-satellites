                <p>Satellite imagery is increasingly a key asset for journalists.
                    <mark>Looking from above often allows us
                        to put a story into context, take a more interesting perspective or show what some power prefers
                        to keep hidden.</mark>
                </p>

                <p>But with hundreds of satellites taking thousands of images of the Earth every day, it is
                    difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff. How can we find relevant stories in this ocean
                    of data?</p>

                <p> This is where <b>artificial intelligence</b> (AI) comes to our aid.</p>

                <p>Branches of AI such as <b>machine learning</b> (ML) or <b>deep learning</b> (DL) enable something
                    unimaginable
                    not long ago:
                    <mark>training an algorithm to process geographic big data to look for patterns,
                        specific details or changes over time.</mark>
                </p>

                <p>It is a technique that has revolutionised
                    fields such as agriculture, international trade and the battle against
                    climate change, but until now it has been little used in journalism.</p>

                <p>Since the 2018 publication of <a href="https://texty.org.ua/d/2018/amber_eng/"
                        target="_blank"><em>Leprosy of the land</em></a>, the first journalistic
                    investigation to use this technique to show the environmental impact of
                    illegal amber mining in Ukraine, there have been only a handful of similar
                    stories.</p>

                <p>"There is a lack of understanding of what we could do with satellite
                    imageries and AI in the newsroom," says <b>Mathias Felipe</b> de Lima Santos,
                    project manager of data-driven projects at <b>InfoAmazonia</b> and researcher in
                    the Digital Media and Observatory at the <b>Federal University of S&atilde;o
                        Paulo</b> (Unifesp).</p>

                <p>He points to <mark>four reasons that hinder the adoption of this technology even
                        among large media outlets:</mark></p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Very few journalists have technical knowledge about AI</li>
                    <li>Media usually do not have the infrastructure (computer power) to process
                        large amounts of data</li>
                    <li>Free satellite imagery cannot identify smaller details because of its
                        low resolution</li>
                    <li>Commercially available high-resolution imagery is very expensive</li>
                </ul>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>That's why collaboration is very important and it's a way of addressing
                            these issues, adds Mathias, who believes that partnerships with civil
                            society organisations and the private sector can help to produce
                            research that goes beyond the limitations of newsroom.

                <h2 class="section-heading"><em>Leprosy of the land</em>, where it all began</h2>

                <p>From 2010 the rise in the international price of amber triggered a
                    <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/illegal-amber-mining-ukraine"
                        target="_blank"> mining
                        fever</a> in north-western Ukraine, country with the second largest amber
                    reserves in the world. In a context of low salaries and few opportunities,
                    thousands of informal workers turned to illegal mining, controlled by mafia
                    groups.
                </p>

                <p>The <b>amber deposits</b> are found under the forests, and to access them, trees are
                    cut down and pits are dug where pressurised water is pumped in. <mark>The result
                        is an environmental disaster with a very clear pattern from above</mark>: whole
                    areas of forest transformed into a grey, pitted, lunar desert.</p>

                <div id="borders" class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider" data-src="visualisation/10795056">
                    <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
                </div>

                <p>By 2018, the amber situation in Ukraine was long known to journalists, but
                    there was no data on its extent. &quot;Before us no one could say what was
                    the scale of this problem,&quot; says <b>Anatoly Bondarenko</b>, data editor of
                    <b>Texty</b>, the Ukrainian agency that investigated the issue.
                </p>

                <p>Inspired by a now defunct university project called <a
                        href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/meet-terrapattern-google-earths-missing-search-engine"
                        target="_blank">Terrapattern</a>,
                    <mark>Bondarenko
                        and his team designed an algorithm to identify traces of illegal mining in
                        satellite imagery obtained via the Bing Maps API.</mark> It was a big challenge for
                    a small newsroom, only possible thanks to the initial collaboration of 20
                    volunteers who identified some 50 mining sites during an Open Data Day.
                </p>

                <p>These first images were used to train the model, which was then applied to a
                    territory of 70,000 km2. The <a href="https://texty.org.ua/d/2018/amber_eng#finalmap"
                        target="_blank">map created by Texty</a> with the results showed
                    that more than 1,000 ha of forest had been affected.</p>

                <div id="borders">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>It was an unusual project, because we did it quite fast. We started, did some prototypes and
                            published it a few weeks later. It was a really interesting project, I liked to work on it
                            so much, recalls Anatoly.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, we sent our results to different governmental structures and we organised a
                            couple of press conferences, but nothing was done.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <p>Illegal mining eventually declined, not because the government fought it,
                    but because amber prices fell and the activity became less lucrative.</p>

                <p>Leprosy of the Land was a groundbreaking story that demonstrated a
                    powerful new research tool. Nominated for the Prix Europa 2018 awards and
                    winner of an SND 2018 award, it is already a classic of data journalism.</p>

                <p>The Amazon also faces the ravages of open-pit mining, but for gold. The lungs
                    of the planet suffer twice: <b>deforestation</b> plus <b>water pollution</b>, because
                    mining takes place around rivers, polluting them with sediment and heavy
                    metals such as mercury.</p>

                <p><a href="https://earthrise.media/" target="_blank">Earthrise Media</a> is a digital agency
                    created by data scientists, specialised

                        the updated Sentinel-2 satellite images</mark>, with a resolution of 10m per pixel,
                    using cloud-free images only. But the final map is built with
                    high-resolution Mapbox imagery (less than 1m per pixel), allowing
                    journalists, activists and citizens to access detailed and very recent
                    information on mining activities.</p>

                <p>Amazon Mining Watch is based on an <a href="https://github.com/earthrise-media/mining-detector"
                        target="_blank">open source</a> convolutional <b>neural network</b>,
                    which processes 440m sided terrain tiles and achieves an accuracy of 98.2%.
                    For every 500 mine detections, there are only about nine misclassifications.
                </p>

                <p>"It went relatively quickly over - says <b>Edward Boyda</b>, journalist,
                    physicist and managing partner at Earthrise about the creation of the
                    algorithm - Probably about a month of effort, but it leans really heavily on
                    previous work that we had done for years and that we were able to transfer
                    to that purpose". <mark>Part of that previous work was an exhaustive initial
                        manual identification of some affected sectors, which was necessary to train
                        the model.</mark></p>

                <p>Adapting the same algorithm to another context, Earthrise teamed up with the
                    <b>Australian Mineroo Foundation</b> to create another platform, <a
                        href="https://globalplasticwatch.org/" target="_blank"><em>Global Plastic Watch</em></a>,
                    which detects <b>plastic landfills</b> and establishes their risk rates in
                    more than 60 countries around the world.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Looking for needles in a haystack -or how to map
                    Argentina's solar farms</h2>

                <p>Satellite imagery is not just for revealing environmental abuses; it can also
                    help in the classic watchdog role of journalism.</p>

                <p>In 2020, <b>LN Data</b>, the data team of the Argentinean newspaper <b>La
                        Naci√≥n</b>, used this technology to <a
                        href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/tecnologia/inteligencia-artificial-mapear-parques-solares-argentina-nid2370879/"
                        target="_blank">track the construction of solar farms</a>
                    across the country and verify that the government was fulfilling its
                    commitments. A daunting task, given that Argentina is the eighth largest
                    country in the world.</p>

                <p>To develop the project, LN Data partnered with <b>Dymaxion Labs</b>, a startup
                    specialising in geospatial data processing. <mark>Using cloud computing, they
                        created and trained a model that processed 7 million images from ESA's
                        Sentinel-2 satellite.</mark></p>

                <p>The algorithm correctly detected 20 of the 24 officially tendered solar farms
                    and also discovered two other private facilities. A demonstration of how AI
                    can find a needle (or several needles) in a haystack.</p>

                <p>As solar farms are similar in structure and shape to agricultural farms, the
                    algorithm relied on <b>infrared bands</b> to differentiate between them.</p>

                <div id="borders" class="flourish-embed flourish-photo-slider" data-src="visualisation/10798590">

                </div>

                <p>But it is key to keep in mind that no technology is magic, nor does it
                    replace traditional reporting. &quot;When you find something, you need to go
                    and investigate that,&quot; says <b>Mathias Felipe</b>, who was involved in the
                    investigation.</p>

                <div id="borders">
                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        <p>We finished the project and these solar parks seemed to be, more or
                            less, at the same level as the government's proposal. But when another
                            journalist investigated in deep about some of the solar farms, she found out
                            that they were built but not actually working.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <p>The companies had indeed delivered the projects on time, but the government had problems
                    connecting these stations to the national grid. <mark>This was not something that could be detected
                        from the sky.</mark></p>

                <p>It is a good example that underlines that technological developments come to help rather than
                    replace traditional journalism.

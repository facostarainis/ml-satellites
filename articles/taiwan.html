                            target="_blank">landed</a> in Taiwan on an
                        official visit. Second in the presidential line of succession, she is the highest-ranking US
                        official to visit the island since 1997.</p>
                    <p>The visit increased tensions between Washington and Beijing. Taiwan is a democracy recognised by
                        only 13 countries around the world; China considers it a rebel province of its territory and has
                        repeatedly claimed that it will take it back even through the use of force.</p>
                    <p>In retaliation to Pelosi's trip, Xi Jinping's government <a
                            href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-62416363" target="_blank">launched</a> a
                        week-long series of military
                        drills around the island.</p>
                    <p>An analysis of radar satellite images processed by artificial intelligence shows that after the
                        start of the exercises, the number of large ships such as container ships, bulk carriers and
                        tankers decreased by more than 50% in the international waters of the Strait.</p>
                    <p>That is a very significant hit on a busy world trade route.</p>

                    <p>The Chinese military exercises began on 4 August at 4:00 UTC and were initially scheduled to end
                        on 7 August at 4:00 UTC, according to China's official <a

                            target="_blank">Xinhua news agency</a>. But they were
                        eventually extended <a
                            href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/10/china-halts-military-drills-around-taiwan-but-war-preparation-continues"
                            target="_blank">until the 10th</a>.</p>

                    <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) deployed more than 100 aircraft, an undetermined number of
                        vessels, and launched more than 10 missiles, conducting operations "of joint blockade, assault
                        on ground and sea targets, airspace control, joint anti-submarine drill, and integrated
                        logistics and support".</p>
                    <p>The last time China had conducted military exercises on this scale in the area was between 1995
                        and 1996.</p>

                    <h3>Impact on maritime traffic</h3>

                    <p>As part of its activities, Beijing banned all ships and aircraft from entering the designated
                        areas, causing delays and increased costs for maritime traffic.</p>
                    <p>Some companies decided to reroute their ships to Taiwan's east coast to avoid the Strait - which
                        involves three extra sailing days - and others postponed loading their cargoes until the
                        following week to avoid risks, according to <a
                            href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-04/china-drills-force-ships-to-circumnavigate-taiwan-danger-zones"
                            target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>.</p>

                    <p>"There is potential for substantial disruption to trade in the region," Peter Williams, an
                        analyst at VesselsValue, a consultancy that monitors global shipping traffic, told CNN Business.
                        According to VesselsValue, there were more than 300 container ships in Taiwanese waters during
                        the drills.</p>

                    <h3>All-seeing eyes from the sky</h3>

                    <p>Usually, ships can be located thanks to the automatic identification system (AIS), the system by
                        which they transmit their position to each other in order to avoid collisions. This is what
                        platforms such as <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com" target="_blank">MarineTraffic</a> use
                        to display real-time maritime traffic.</p>

                    <p>But by simply <a
                            href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/revealed-russia-linked-superyachts-going-dark-to-avoid-tracking-systems"
                            target="_blank">turning off their transponders</a>, any vessel can disappear from the
                        positioning
                        systems.</p>

                    <p>There are many reasons to go dark: to hide an illegal act such as fishing in prohibited waters or
                        smuggling, to avoid sanctions, or because they are on a military mission.</p>

                    <p>This is where satellite imagery can provide valuable information: no ship can avoid being spotted
                        from the sky.</p>

                    <h3>In search of safer waters</h3>

                    <p>To understand how maritime traffic was impacted, I analysed Sentinel-1 images from the same
                        location but on different dates, focusing on the northern Taiwan Strait, where Chinese forces
                        began military exercises from 4 August in two areas.</p>

                    <p>This meant blocking almost 50% of the width of the Strait's international waters.</p>

                    <p>The images analysed are 12 days apart, on 24 July and 5 August, and were taken by Sentinel-1 at
                        the same exact time (10:01 UTC). On both days there were good weather conditions for navigation,
                        which makes it possible to rule out that the differences found are due to the weather.</p>

                    <p>When comparing the ships detected in both images, it is clear that at the start of the military
                        exercises the container ships and tankers abandoned their usual route through the centre of the
                        strait, moving towards safer waters.</p>

                    <p>The algorithm also revealed the possible location of some of the military ships involved in the
                        operation and a remarkable concentration of vessels in a small area.</p>

                    <h3>Is it possible to identify a military vessel?</h3>

                    <p>By cross-referencing the Sentinel-1 image with official Chinese sources, it is possible to obtain
                        some more data.</p>
                    <p>On 6 August, the Xinhua news agency published some reports on the activities of the previous
                        day, when Sentinel-1 captured the radar image. Among them is a <a
                            href="https://english.news.cn/20220805/5142dddda03b4d3a898e9fe69b62b2c3/c.html"
                            target="_blank">video</a> of a ship in action that
                        appears to be the <i>Yiyang</i> (548), a <a
                            href="https://www.naval-technology.com/projects/type-054a-jiangkai-ii-class-frigate/"
                            target="_blank">Type 054A</a> frigate of the Chinese forces.</p>

                    <p>The image below compares three screenshots from that video with an image of the <i>Yiyang</i>
                        (548)
                        released in 2013 by the Japanese Ministry of Defence, which allows to verify that it is the same
                        ship.</p>

                                target="_blank">a video</a> published by Xinhua news agency | Below: Frigate
                            Yiyang (548), <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CNS_Yiyang_(FFG-548)_3.jpg"

                    </figure>

                    <p>As the <i>Yiyang</i> (548) is 134.1 metres long and 16 metres wide, it could well be ship 1, 5 or
                        6 identified by the algorithm in the military exercise areas. The resolution of the Sentinel-1
                        SAR image is 10m per pixel, so the measurements made have an estimate of ± 10m.</p>

                    <p>Ships 2, 3 and 4, on the other hand, are either too large or too small to be the <i>Yiyang</i>
                        (548).</p>

                    <figure class="image">

                    </figure>

                    <p>It should be noted that the ship detection algorithm was only applied to military exercise zones
                        1 and 2, so the <i>Yiyang</i> (548) could have been sailing in another sector at the time of
                        Sentinel-1's overflight.</p>
                    <p>China has several Type 054A frigates, all of the same size, which may also have participated in
                        the exercises and may be one or more of the ships detected. Finally, the video published may
                        have been recorded on a different day, so it cannot be reliably verified that the <i>Yiyang</i>
                        (548)
                        was there either.</p>
                    <p>But beyond its limitations, this methodology, complemented by other sources of information, may
                        help to identify some of the units used in the military operation.</p>

                <h4>METHODOLOGY</h4>


                <p>I used Sentinel-1 imagery from 24/07/22 and 05/08/22, downloaded using <a
                        href="https://fromgistors.blogspot.com/p/semi-automatic-classification-plugin.html"
                        target="_blank">SCP</a> for QGIS.</p>

                <p>I processed the imagery using SNAP 9.0. First I applied the Orbit File and ran the Ocean Object
                    Detection algorithm, using the <a href="https://www.marineregions.org/sources.php"
                        target="_blank">IHO Sea Areas dataset</a> to mask the sea, and with the default parameters,
                    except for
                    the Target Window Size (m) of the AdaptiveThresholding, which I set to 30 (to detect ships of 30
                    metres or more).</p>

                <p>To clean the data I removed all the offshore windmills that the algorithm had detected as false
                    positives (+500), by manual inspection and by using to <a
                        href="https://map.4coffshore.com/offshorewind/" target="_blank">4C Offshore map</a>. I also
                    removed all ships detected
                    with duplicate coordinates.</p>

                <p>The final database of detected ships is available <a
                        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mAW6iStp-gn5K54aNcruokjjw3P_-VYxHnVKw5WXHxs/edit?usp=sharing"
                        target="_blank">here</a>. CRS is WGS84.</p>

                <p>To calculate the surface area of the ships I multiplied the width by the length, as detected by SNAP.
                    Sentinel-1 has a resolution of 10m per pixel, so there may be measurement and/or positional errors
                    in that range, in addition to the estimation errors of the detection algorithm.</p>

                <p>I processed the geographic information with QGIS. The tiles for the base map are © CARTO. The
                    territorial data for internal and territorial waters of China and Taiwan are from the Flanders
                    Marine Institute (2019) and are available at <a href="https://www.marineregions.org/"
                        target="_blank">Marineregions.org</a>. Coordinates of military exercise
                    areas were published by <a
                        href="https://english.news.cn/20220802/913b020aaabf4e449223b6c88b956d25/c.html"
                        target="_blank">Xinhua</a>.</p>


                <p>Although I did not use them for the final piece, I also processed images from the 12/07/22 Sentinel-1
                    overflight of Taiwan. The number of total ships, large ships, and ships detected in international
                    waters are very similar to those of 24/07/22, reinforcing the exceptionality of the situation as of
                    05/08/22.</p>

                    What stories can be told with a combination of <b>satellite imagery and AI</b>? In this second part
                    of this
                    two-part article, you will find some story ideas to put into practice.

                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of these stories can be told using satellite data alone, without using AI;
                    <mark>the main advantage of algorithms is quantifying phenomena, identifying patterns, showing
                        changes or finding a "needle in a haystack" across large territories or different time periods.
                        Or to automate a process:</mark>
                    since satellites produce recurring data, you can build, for example, a
                    platform that automatically detects changes in the size of forests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I adopt here the framework developed by <b>Paul Bradshaw</b> for <b>data journalism</b>, which
                    recognises <b>eight types
                        of stories</b>: scale, change, ranking, variation, exploration, exploration, relationships,
                    stories
                    about data and stories through data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the stories I propose follow existing examples; others are paths not yet travelled that are
                    worth exploring. The underlying idea, in any case, is that they will serve as inspiration for
                    journalists interested in exploring these techniques further.
                </p>

                    <h4>Scale stories</h4>
                    <p>
                        These are stories that allow us to quantify a phenomenon, either to provide context or to
                        understand
                        the scale of a problem. Satellite information is especially useful where there is no official
                        data,
                        which is common in the global south, or when dealing with illegal activities.

                    <h4>Change stories</h4>
                    <p>
                        These involve a time dimension and tell how something has (or has not) changed. Decades-old
                        satellite data, such as from the Landsat programme, are very powerful for looking at the
                        consequences of climate change. Some current providers, such as Planet, produce daily images of
                        the
                        same location, allowing even very small changes to be monitored.

                    <h4>Ranking stories</h4>
                    <p>
                        These are stories that establish an order, revealing which is the best, worst or "different" in
                        a
                        series. Algorithms and computational power on satellite imagery make it possible to compare very
                        large territories, even entire countries. Using the same dataset (the same satellite) provides
                        an
                        extra advantage and overcomes the problems that arise when comparing data collected in different
                        jurisdictions, which are not always standardised.

                        As
                        with ranking histories, always using the same dataset of satellite images allows different areas
                        to
                        be compared using a single criterion.

                        These are stories that encourage the user to get involved in the exploration of a phenomenon,
                        with
                        or without interactivity. Satellite imagery can be used to build large maps where each reader
                        can
                        explore what is happening near their home.

                        phenomena, with Bradshaw's key caveat: correlation never implies causation. Satellite imagery
                        can be
                        used to account for the two phenomena being compared; or for one of them and use other
                        information
                        (official data already available, for example) to account for the other.

                    <h4>Stories about data</h4>
                    <p>
                        These are stories about the data itself: whether it is missing, inaccurate or flawed. Satellite
                        imagery can be used to verify or question the quality of official datasets; missing or censored
                        imagery is also saying something.

                    <p>
                        In these stories, data is the means to unveil or discover something. Particularly useful here is
                        the
                        use of AI to find patterns, infrastructure or objects in a large amount of satellite imagery.

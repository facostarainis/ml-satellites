                    <p>Fifteen years after the Forestry Law was approved, the agricultural industry continues to trample
                        Argentina's forests.</p>

                    <p>Over the last year, some 7,200 hectares of forest have been cleared in the north of Chaco
                        Province, in areas that are protected by law.</p>

                    <p>This is the equivalent of more than 10,000 football pitches - some 28 football pitches per day -
                        and over a third of the total area of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.</p>

                    <p>The data comes from an analysis of satellite imagery from June 2021 and June 2022 processed by an
                        algorithm to help identify changes in land use across a protected area of almost 35,000 km2,
                        where deforestation is forbidden.</p>

                    <p>The following interactive map shows in detail the changes over the last twelve months. The
                        methodology and code used are available here.</p>

                    <p>On the left side the region is shown as photographed by ESA's Sentinel-2 mission throughout May
                        and June 2021. On the right, the images are from June 2022 and the new 113 deforested patches
                        are marked in red.</p>

                    <p>The average size of each deforested patch is 64 ha, while the largest area deforested in a single
                        patch is 370 ha.</p>

                    <p>Use the slider and zoom in to compare the before and after of each patch of lost forest.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: the map uses a very large number of images, so it may take a few seconds to load all the
                        layers.</p>

                    <h3>The never-ending logging</h3>

                    <p>According to the 2020 State of the Environment Report published by the Ministry of Environment
                        and Sustainable Development, between 1998 and 2020, Argentina lost 6.9 of its 54.3 million
                        hectares of native forests, 13% of the total.</a>.</p>

                    <p>In 2007, to monitor this loss, the Forestry Law was passed, establishing three categories of
                        native forests:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Category I (red): very high conservation value. They cannot be exploited.
                        </li>
                        <li>Category II (yellow): medium conservation value. They cannot be cleared and can only be used
                            sustainably, for tourism, harvesting or scientific research.</li>
                        <li>Category III (green): can be partially or totally transformed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Local classification was entrusted to each of the 23 provincial governments, together with the
                        obligation to update this territorial register every five years.</p>

                    <p>In practice, very few provinces complied: only in 2016 did they all complete the initial
                        categorisation and by 2020 only five had complied with the first update.</p>


                    <figure class="image">
                        <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1669089">
                            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
                        </div>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Although the new law slowed down the destruction, it could not prevent it completely. Especially
                        in the north, in the provinces of Chaco, Salta, Formosa and Santiago del Estero, where the main
                        cause of deforestation is the expansion of the so-called "agricultural frontier".</p>
                    <p>From 2008 onwards, 85% of forest loss occurred in these provinces, in the Gran Chaco forest. It
                        is the second largest forest in Latin America after the Amazon, covering part of Argentina,
                        Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil for some 650,000 km2.</p>

                    <h3>The situation in Chaco Province
                    </h3>

                    <p>The Chaco Province (named after the forest itself) is one of the most affected. According to
                        official data, between 2007 and 2020 it lost a monumental half a million hectares of forest, the
                        equivalent of 25 times the size of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.</p>

                    <p>Environmental organisations such as Greenpeace and FARN have reported that in recent years the
                        Chaco government has authorised dozens of individual re-categorisations to allow logging,
                        downgrading areas that were originally protected from yellow to green.</p>

                    <p>This goes against the original spirit of the law: according to the Ministry of Environment and
                        Sustainable Development, re-categorisations "should only be granted for exceptional cases and
                        never be of general and systematic application".</p>

                    <p>In October 2020, in fact, a Chaco court suspended all land clearing and land use changes made
                        since 2014, when the province should have updated its protected areas register but failed to do
                        so.</p>

                    <p>Eight years later, the update is still pending, but deforestation continues unabated.</p>

                    <h3>Yellow... but almost red
                    </h3>

                    <p>The algorithm didn't detect any forest loss in category I (red) areas between June 2021 and June 2022,
                        but some deforestations occurred in category II (yellow) areas very close to the red
                        boundary.</p>

                        Provincial Park, one of Chaco's most important flora and fauna reserves.</p>

                    <p>Three other areas were cleared within metres of the Bermejito River, despite the fact that the
                        law prohibits deforestation in any area within 30 metres of its banks.</p>

                    <h3>How does the algorithm work to detect deforestation?
                    </h3>

                    <p>To identify deforestation, I used a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest (RF) to perform what is called a supervised classification. The name of the algorithm has nothing to do with its usefulness for detecting forests: it is named after the way it processes data, building "decision trees".</p>

                    <p>First I manually categorised different land uses (water, crops, forest, low vegetation and deforestation) at many points in a satellite image. I then fed this information to the algorithm, so that it could learn to distinguish the categories on its own and replicate the classification for the entire northern Chaco. </p>

                    <p>For more information, scope and limitations and access to the source code, see Methodology.</p>

                    <p>The following figure compares the original satellite images and the classification performed by the algorithm in both periods to show how it works.</p>

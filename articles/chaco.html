                    <p>Fifteen years after the Forestry Law was approved, the agricultural industry continues to trample
                        Argentina's forests.</p>

                    <p>Over the last year, some 7,200 hectares of forest have been cleared in the north of Chaco
                        Province, in areas that are protected by law.</p>

                    <p>This is the equivalent of more than 10,000 football pitches - some 28 football pitches per day -
                        and over a third of the total area of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.</p>

                    <p>The data comes from an analysis of satellite images of June 2021 and June 2022 processed by an
                        algorithm that helped identify land-use changes in a protected area of almost 35,000 km2, where
                        deforestation is forbidden.</p>

                    <p>The following interactive map shows in detail the changes over the last twelve months. The
                        methodology and code used are available <a href="#methodology">here</a>.</p>

                    <p>On the left side the region is shown as photographed by ESA's Sentinel-2 mission throughout May
                        and June 2021. On the right, the images are from June 2022 and the new 113 deforested patches
                        are marked in red.</p>

                    <p>The average size of each deforested patch is 64 ha, while the largest area deforested in a single
                        patch is 370 ha.</p>

                    <p>Use the slider and zoom in to compare the before and after of each patch of lost forest.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: the map uses a very large number of images, so it may take a few seconds to load all the
                        layers.</p>

                    <h3>The never-ending logging</h3>

                    <p>According to the 2020 State of the Environment Report published by the Ministry of Environment
                        and Sustainable Development, between 1998 and 2020, Argentina lost 6.9 of its 54.3 million
                        hectares of native forests, 13% of the total.</p>

                    <p>In 2007, to monitor this loss, the Forestry Law was passed, establishing three categories of
                        native forests:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Category I (red): very high conservation value. They cannot be exploited.
                        </li>
                        <li>Category II (yellow): medium conservation value. They cannot be cleared and can only be used
                            sustainably, for tourism, gathering or scientific research.</li>
                        <li>Category III (green): can be partially or totally transformed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Local classification was entrusted to each of the 23 provincial governments, together with the
                        obligation to update this territorial register every five years.</p>

                    <p>In practice, very few provinces complied: only in 2016 all completed the initial categorisation
                        and by 2020 only five had complied with the first mandatory update.</p>


                    <figure class="image">
                        <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/1669089">
                            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
                        </div>
                    </figure>

                    <p>Although the new law slowed down the destruction, it could not prevent it completely. Especially
                        in the north, in the provinces of Chaco, Salta, Formosa and Santiago del Estero, where the main
                        cause of deforestation is the expansion of the so-called "agricultural frontier".</p>
                    <p>From 2008 onwards, 85% of the country's forest loss occurred in these provinces, in the Gran
                        Chaco forest. It
                        is the second largest forest in Latin America after the Amazon, covering part of Argentina,
                        Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil for some 650,000 km2.</p>

                    <h3>The situation in Chaco Province
                    </h3>

                    <p>The Chaco Province (named after the forest itself) is one of the most affected. According to
                        official data, between 2007 and 2020 it lost a monumental half a million hectares of forest, the
                        equivalent of 25 times the size of the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires.</p>

                    <p>Environmental organisations such as Greenpeace and FARN have reported that in recent years the
                        Chaco government has authorised dozens of individual re-categorisations to allow logging,
                        downgrading areas that were originally protected from yellow to green.</p>

                    <p>This goes against the original spirit of the law: according to the Ministry of Environment and
                        Sustainable Development, re-categorisations "should only be granted for exceptional cases and
                        never be of general and systematic application".</p>

                    <p>In October 2020, in fact, a Chaco court suspended all land clearing and land use changes made
                        since 2014, when the province should have updated its protected areas register but failed to do
                        so.</p>

                    <p>Eight years later, the update is still pending, but deforestation continues unabated.</p>

                    <h3>Yellow... but almost red
                    </h3>

                    <p>The algorithm didn't detect any forest loss in category I (red) areas between June 2021 and June
                        2022,
                        but some deforestations occurred in category II (yellow) areas very close to the red
                        boundary.</p>

                    <p>A patch of about 70 hectares of native forest was cleared just 1.3 km from the Loro Hablador
                        Provincial Park, one of Chaco's most important flora and fauna reserves.</p>

                    <p>Three other areas were cleared within metres of the Bermejito River, despite the fact that the
                        law prohibits deforestation in any area within 30 metres of its banks.</p>

                    <h3>How does the algorithm work to detect deforestation?
                    </h3>

                    <p>To identify deforestation, I used a machine learning algorithm called Random Forest (RF) to
                        perform what is called a supervised classification. The name of the algorithm has nothing to do
                        with its usefulness for detecting forests: it is named after the way it processes data, building
                        "decision trees".</p>

                    <p>First I manually categorised different land uses (water, crops, forest, low vegetation and
                        deforestation) at many points in a satellite image. I then fed this information to the
                        algorithm, so that it could learn to distinguish the categories on its own and replicate the
                        classification for the entire northern Chaco. </p>

                    <p>The following figure compares the original satellite images and the classification performed by
                        the algorithm in both periods to show how it works.</p>

                <p>The region of interest (ROI) delimits the category I and II protected forests in Chaco to the north
                    of the parallel 26°07'30.8 "S. Although there are also protected areas to the south of this
                    parallel, this ROI was chosen because it concentrates the vast majority of forests in the province.
                </p>
                <p>As there is no open data available on category II forest areas, the perimeter was manually plotted in

                <h4 id="methodology">METHODOLOGY</h4>

                <p><strong>Satellite imagery</strong></p>
                <p>To build the satellite map mosaics of the region I used Sentinel-2 images in L2A (atmospherically
                    corrected) mode.</p>
                <p>I made the selection, image processing and model construction using <a
                        href="https://earthengine.google.com/" target="_blank">Google
                        Earth Engine (GEE)</a>. I used bands B2, B3, B4, B8, B11 and B12.</p>
                <p>For the year 2021, I used imagery from 25 May to 30 June; for the year 2022, from 1 to 30 June. In
                    both cases I set a maximum of 2% cloud coverage. I chose images from the same month in different
                    years to limit the impact of crop seasonality.</p>
                <p><strong>Model creation and deforestation detection</strong></p>
                <p>For 2021 I created 612 datapoints and the code I used, based on <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_yJDMgRfik" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>, is

                        target="_blank">here</a>; the
                    average accuracy (running the model 10 times) was 68.6%. For 2022 I created 597 datapoints and the
                    code is available <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/6edeec81980558a659b057fe3d5129c2"
                        target="_blank">here</a>; the average accuracy (running the model 10 times) was 74.8%. Most of
                    the
                    data points are the same for both years because the land use did not change much.</p>
                <p>Next, I mitigated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt-and-pepper_noise"
                        target="_blank">salt and pepper noise</a>, and exported the resulting classified land images of
                    the
                    ROI for 2021 and 2022. I imported
                    them into QGIS, divided them into grids, and manually compared the changes to detect possible
                    deforestation. I used the criteria of change from dark green ("Forest") or light green ("Low
                    vegetation") to red ("Deforestation") as a sign of possible deforestation.</p>
                <p>I manually delimited each of the nearly 130 detected patches and compared them with the original
                    satellite images to eliminate false positives.</p>
                <p><strong>Possible model improvements</strong></p>
                <p>Several things can be tried to improve the model, which I was not able to test this time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The category "Deforestation" does not mean that the land has been recently deforested but that
                        there is no more forest or low vegetation in that sector; in most cases these are
                        harvested fields; since what is relevant is to detect forest loss, it might be useful to merge
                        it with the under-represented category "Crops"
                    </li>
                    <li>Data points created in the "Urban" category were left out, as the models performed better
                        without them, probably because cities occupy a very small part of the area analysed. They could
                        be incorporated if the model is improved.</li>
                    <li>Test different band configurations</li>
                    <li>Test different parameters for the Random Forest model or use other models. The CART model gave
                        on average 10% lower accuracy</li>
                    <li>Automate the detection of changes from "Forest" or "Low vegetation" to "Deforestation"</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Interactive map (webapp)</strong></p>
                <p>The <a href="https://facostarainis.users.earthengine.app/view/chaco-deforestation-2021-2022"
                        target="_blank">interactive map</a> was created in GEE following <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C63lbekwLWc" target="_blank">this</a> tutorial and the
                    commented code is available
                    <a href="https://code.earthengine.google.com/5cc9353bade03fd84a21a9dae97c2d3e"

                </p>
                <p>As a lot of satellite images are used, the app may take a while to load some of the layers each time
                    you zoom in.</p>

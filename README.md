![Image](/assets/img/parana_card.jpg)

An introductory guide to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and satellite imagery in journalistic pieces.

In this project you will find the best examples on how to use *Machine Learning* (ML) and *Deep Learning* (DL) to find stories in *satellite images*, tips from experts, some ofmy own productions, possible story ideas to investigate and much more.
                    
My hope is that it will serve as a starting point for those who want to explore these techniques, which have enormous potential in journalism.
